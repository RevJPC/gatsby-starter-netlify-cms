### About me

Welcome friends! My name is Amy Lewis. I began sewing at my mother and grandmother’s feet at the young age of 4. I loved making clothing and quilts as a teenager. At East Tennessee State University, I studied art with a concentration in fiber and textiles and a speciality in traditional Appalachian weaving. I studied long arm quilting with Angela Huffman (world known APQS long arm quilter and dealer). Sewing and quilting is my heritage and love. I can’t wait to help you turn your ideas, quilt tops, and heirlooms into fruition.
